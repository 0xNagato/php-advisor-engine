# Welcome to PRIMA!

Hello from PRIMA!

You’ve been referred to PRIMA by {{ $referrer }}, and we are excited to have you aboard!

PRIMA was created for two very simple reasons:  To make it easier for consumers to access in-demand restaurants and experiences and to maximize the revenues of all those involved in the process, including you.

As a PRIMA Concierge, you will have access to book reservations at the most in-demand restaurants and experiences around the world, reservations that are often not available through traditional channels.  And now, rather than asking for a "favor," you will be compensated for the booking through PRIMA, at scale.

**Here's how PRIMA works:**

After you create your PRIMA account, you will have access to the PRIMA Reservation Hub as well as the PRIMA Platform, where all of your earnings will be visible in real time.

**As a PRIMA Concierge, you will receive:**

- 10% of the gross booking fees for the first 20 monthly reservations.
- 12% of the gross booking fees for reservations 20 through 50.
- 15% of the gross booking fees for any reservations after the first 50.

**Example:**

If you are booking your 15th monthly reservation, and the reservation is for 6 people, the total booking fee is $400 and you will earn 12% or $48 for the reservation.

If you are booking your 60th monthly reservation, and the reservation is for 4 people, the total booking fee is $300 and you will earn 15% or $45 for the reservation.

All tiers reset at the end of each calendar month.

In addition, PRIMA offers a two-tier referral structure for concierge referrals, allowing you to earn up to an additional 15% in revenue.

**Here's how it works:**

You can also earn additional income by referring a concierge just like yourself to PRIMA.  PRIMA will pay you 10% of platform fees for any concierge you refer, plus an additional 5% for any concierge they may refer.

**Example:**

If a concierge you referred is booking their 15th monthly reservation, and the reservation is for 6 people, the total booking fee is $400.  The restaurant will earn 60% or $240, the concierge will earn 12% or $48 for the reservation.  You will receive 10% of the balance, or ($400 less $240 less $48) * 10% = $11.20

If a concierge that was referred by a concierge that you referred is booking their 15th monthly reservation, and the reservation is for 6 people, the total booking fee is $400.  The restaurant will earn 60% or $240, the concierge will earn 12% or $48 for the reservation.  You will receive 5% of the balance, or ($400 less $240 less $48) * 5% = $5.60

All commissions earned are paid out on the 15th of every month, for commissions earned in the prior month.  One payment across all of our restaurant and experience partners.  No invoices are necessary.

We look forward to working with you and are excited to have you on our team.
