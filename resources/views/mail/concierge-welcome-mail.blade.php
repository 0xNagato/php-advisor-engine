    # Welcome to PRIMA!

    Thank you for joining us, your participation means the world to us and we will work hard to earn your trust.

    We started PRIMA for one simple reason, to help you make more money.

    With years of experience in the online advertising and hospitality industry, we have seen firsthand how inefficient
    the system can be, and PRIMA aims to solve many pressing issues for top venues across the globe so that you can
    focus on what you do best - curating amazing meals for food lovers like us.

    With PRIMA, your clients will have access to top venues around the globe without having to book reservations 30+
    days in advance and you will be able to earn commission on any bookings made through your concierge account.

    As a PRIMA concierge, you will have access to our entire venue network and can offer value to your customers
    far beyond your initial interaction.

    Additionally, if you would like to refer a venue or concierge to the PRIMA Network, please contact us to join
    our partner team, we would love to have you help us grow our network.

    As always, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact your PRIMA partner.
